The adage of ""It's who you know, not what you know"" really is difficult to reconcile when you feel like you have no network to get to your next career step.

Over the past 12 years, I heard this advice a lot as I moved around from city to city—both in the US and abroad. With every move, I had to rebuild my network, and it was *really* difficult each time.

If you're someone who's ever experienced a life transition, like a career change, having a child, or deciding to return to work after taking an extended leave, then this story is probably all too familiar.

If you're a woman, minority, or person with a non-traditional background which, when combined, represents the majority of the U.S. population, then it's *really* difficult to make any change because people already have these preconceived notions about you.

It's not an excuse, but an acknowledgment that biases are our reality.

Our reality is harsh on the job search. And we all could use help in fending off common biases in our job search so we can overcome the challenges we face in our transitions.

That's why we built JobFit - to help people in transition broaden the ""who you know,"" so you can show them your ""what you know."" We primarily assist people who are interested in transitioning to a new city for their next career step.

Whether you want to move for family, a change of scenery, or better opportunities, our goal is to help people find job referrals in cities where they want to work.

Find any job referral for any specific job to any particular company.

Our process of applying for job referrals is simple.

1. Find a company where you want a job referral.
2. Anonymously answer a few questions on what interested you about the company. Anonymity is to protect you from bias against your location, among other hiring bias.
3. A non-recruiter employee at the company will review your answers. If the employee likes your responses, they gain access to your name and resume for the job referral.


Here are some job referrals you can directly start connecting to right away:

For a job referral to DroneDeploy - https://formyreferral.getjobfit.com/MXBH7tBNl1?utm_source=craigslist&utm_medium=software_qa_dba_etc&utm_campaign=boston&utm_term=dronedeploy%2C%20v1&utm_content=sponsor_link

User Experience (UX) Research Lead
Location: Flexible, within the United States (Boston, MA preferred)
Position is available: Immediately
WHO WE ARE
Every student deserves opportunities in life, and every educator committed to providing those opportunities, deserves support. Those beliefs drive us to work alongside schools to support great teaching so that we can work towards guaranteeing that all students are receiving high quality instruction. We partner with over 900 schools - both district and charter - in underserved communities around the country, thus impacting more than 330,000 students. Third-party evaluations confirm that when schools have the right basic conditions in place and partner with ANet, they achieve 6-8 months of additional learning over a two-year period compared to schools not partnering with ANet. 
 
At ANet we are committed to living out our core values, both across our organization and with our partner schools. We acknowledge that systemic inequities impact student access to opportunities and that in order to ensure educational equity for all students, we must center on the experiences of those from marginalized communities to guide our work. We work to deepen our understanding of how race, class, power and privilege influence the education system as well as influence our own perspectives. To do so, we provide ongoing learning opportunities through org-wide professional development, affinity groups, working groups, and resource sharing.
 
Individuals who join ANet have the opportunity to be part of a dynamic, values driven, and team-oriented organization that is committed to having impact in schools by investing in each other and learning together. We were named as The NonProfit Time's “Best Nonprofits to Work For” and work tirelessly to foster a working environment where the unique perspectives, backgrounds, and identities of our staff members are valued.
THE OPPORTUNITY
As User Experience (UX) Research Lead, you will work collaboratively with Product Managers, Engineers, and stakeholders across ANet's National and Regional teams to craft an exceptional end user experience that maximizes the impact of our technology in service to educators and students. This is both a strategic and tactical role with the opportunity to partner with leaders across ANet to identify research needs and influence product and design decisions. This role reports to the Vice President of Product.
WHAT YOU'LL DO
Establish ANet's product research and UX practice in pursuit of maximizing the impact, effectiveness, and ease of use of our educator and student-facing tools
Guide product research throughout the product life-cycle from early stage generative research, through iterative UI testing and post-launch measurement
Deliver actionable and relevant product research insights (via user interviews, usability studies, focus groups, surveys, etc.) aligned to both strategic and tactical product and designs decisions
Manage the information architecture, user interface, and interaction flow of our educator and student-facing products
Create low and high-fidelity wireframes and mockups to facilitate product discovery research and development
In partnership with Product Managers, develop user personae, customer journey maps, conceptual diagrams, wireframes, and prototypes in support of our product roadmap
Build strong empathy and advocate passionately for our end users, ensuring that the product experience is aligned to user needs and expectations
Continually iterate and evolve the way we design for and learn from our customers.
WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU BRING
In order to be successful in this role, candidates must demonstrate the following:
You have a passionate commitment to and a sense of urgency for the support of schools, along with a belief that all students can achieve at high levels.
You are motivated by working in an environment where we live out our core values daily. You are eager to examine personal archetypes and biases while discussing topics related to race, class, and privilege which relate to ANet's Advance Equity and People Matter values, and our work towards becoming an anti-racist organization. 
You've got about 5 years of hands-on experience and a track record of success with user experience design, information architecture, and product research for digital products.
You know how to champion a UX research function and act as a customer advocate; you've translated research into actionable insights and recommendations that have had a significant impact on the customer experience
You have exceptional project management skills and are able to effectively manage multiple complex projects with competing deadlines while working cross-team and synthesizing feedback and input from product management, engineering, and marketing functions.
You know how to weave key insights into a compelling narrative; your presentation and persuasion skills have led to success in building buy-in from leaders - whether in a formal presentation or via ad-hoc discussions - for bold ideas. 
You have expertise creating prototypes at various levels of fidelity to articulate and test user flows using modern tools (e.g., InVision, Keynote, etc), interaction and visual design documents, user stories, conceptual models, annotated wireframes, storyboards, creative briefs—and more.
You can demonstrate fluency in best practices for web-based and mobile information architecture and responsive design, as well as deep and broad knowledge of usability principles and techniques. 
You're always willing to roll up your sleeves and do what is necessary to meet team goals and effectively deliver in a fast-paced, dynamic environment. 
You have a strong portfolio of UX/UI design work demonstrating your experience working on digital projects from concept to launch. 
 
Ideal candidates may also demonstrate the following preferred qualifications:
You bring prior experience in K-12 education or Ed Tech.
You have studied UX research, digital design, graphic design, and/or human-computer interaction.

You have a proven ability in a variety of design tools such as InDesign, Sketch, Adobe XD, Photoshop, Illustrator, and prototyping tools (Invision, Axure, Framer, etc.). 
WHAT WE OFFER

Benefits we offer include: health, dental and vision insurance where ANet pays 80% of the cost of these benefits for employees and their families/domestic partner; 3 weeks of vacation (4 weeks after two years with ANet); 10 paid holidays with paid days off between the Christmas and New Year's holidays; a paid floating holiday; paid sick & personal days; paid parental leave; retirement plan options; commuter benefits; tuition reimbursement; flexible spending accounts; short and long-term disability coverage; and basic life and personal accident insurance.

ABOUT AMERICAN PROMISE (www.americanpromise.net)

Our passionate team inspires, empowers, and unites Americans across the political spectrum to build a healthy democracy and lasting American republic. We have an audacious goal: amend the United States Constitution to stop the corrupting influence of money in our political system and secure the rights of all Americans to have their voices heard equally in the halls of government.

To achieve this goal, we empower citizens in all 50 states to learn, connect, take effective action, and lead efforts to mobilize their communities and ensure their representatives pass and ratify this Constitutional amendment. By working together—across party lines, hometowns, motivations, and skills—we can realize our national vision of human liberty, equal rights, and effective self-government. In all that we do, we strive to live our values of empowerment, positivity, courage, grit, responsiveness, respect, candor, and cross-partisanship.

Since our founding in 2016, we have launched forty American Promise chapters across the nation, supported hundreds of thousands of citizen actions, and played a key role in five state citizen ballot initiatives and six legislative campaigns. As of right now, 20 states have formally called for an amendment to authorize limits on money in elections and ensure all Americans are represented in our political system. As a result, more than twenty million Americans have had a chance to vote on this constitutional amendment and more than 135 million Americans live in states that have demanded the Amendment.

From a start-up, to an agile team, to a national cross-partisan force, American Promise is continuing to grow this remarkable movement and is now expanding our team. We are seeking an analytical, effective and efficient person to select, maintain and improve where and how we collect, store, organize, manage, move, and access our data and turn it into relevant and accessible information for all stakeholders.
